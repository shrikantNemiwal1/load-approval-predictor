# Loan Status Prediction - A Data Science Case Study

This project focuses on building a model to predict whether a loan will be approved based on various customer details. It addresses a binary classification problem, where the goal is to automate the loan approval process.

## Objective

The objective is to automate the loan eligibility determination based on customer information provided during the online application process. Key factors include:
- Gender, Marital Status, Education
- Number of Dependents, Applicant and Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount, Credit History, Property Area, and more

*The primary goal is to predict which applicants are likely to have their loan approved.*

## Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following columns:

- *LoanID*: Unique identifier for each loan
- *Gender*: Male/Female
- *Married*: Applicant’s marital status (Yes/No)
- *Dependents*: Number of dependents
- *Education*: Educational qualification (Graduate/Undergraduate)
- *SelfEmployed*: Self-employed status (Yes/No)
- *ApplicantIncome*: Applicant’s income
- *CoapplicantIncome*: Income of the coapplicant
- *LoanAmount*: Loan amount (in thousands)
- *LoanAmountTerm*: Duration of the loan (in months)
- *CreditHistory*: Record of the applicant’s credit history
- *PropertyArea*: Type of area (Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural)
- *LoanStatus*: Target variable indicating loan approval (Yes/No)

# Project Workflow

### 1. Introduction & Problem Understanding
### 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values for both categorical and numerical features.
   - Detection and treatment of outliers in key features like income and loan amounts.
   - Data transformation techniques, including log transformation for normalizing distributions.

### 3. Feature Analysis:
   - Analyzing the relationships between categorical variables (e.g., marital status, education level) and the target variable (loan approval).
   - Identifying key patterns such as higher approval rates for married applicants, graduates, and those from semi-urban areas.

### 4. Data Imbalance Handling:
   - Utilization of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the target class distribution.

### 5. Model Building:
   - Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
   - Logistic Regression was found to provide the best performance on this dataset.

### 6. Model Evaluation:
   - Comparison of model accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
   - Logistic Regression was selected as the final model due to its balance of simplicity and performance.

## Data Handling Strategies

- *Missing Data*: Mode or median imputation was applied to handle missing values.
- *Outliers*: Outliers in key features like ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, and LoanAmount were identified and treated to improve model accuracy.
- *Data Normalization*: Numeric features were log-transformed to reduce skewness and improve model predictions.

## Key Insights:

- *Marital Status*: Married applicants are more likely to have their loans approved.
- *Education*: Graduates have a higher approval rate than non-graduates.
- *Property Area*: Applicants from semi-urban areas have a greater likelihood of approval.
- *Self-Employment*: Self-employed individuals have a marginally lower approval rate.

## Future Enhancements:

- *Feature Engineering*: Further exploration of potential features and transformations to enhance model performance.
- *Model Exploration*: Investigate additional algorithms, such as ensemble methods, for potential improvements.
- *Feature Importance*: Perform a feature importance analysis to identify which variables have the most influence on loan approval decisions.
- *Data Quality and Expansion*: Continuously monitor data quality and consider expanding the dataset for greater generalizability.
- *Deployment & Monitoring*: Once finalized, the model can be deployed for real-time predictions, with ongoing monitoring for performance degradation.
- *Compliance*: Ensure that the model adheres to legal and regulatory guidelines in the financial sector, especially regarding fairness and transparency in loan approval.

## Technologies & Tools

- *Programming Languages*: Python (libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- *Machine Learning Models*: 
   - KNN Classifier
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Logistic Regression (selected as best-performing model)
   - Naive Bayes
   - Random Forest Classifier

*Logistic Regression* provided the best balance between accuracy and interpretability for this use case.
